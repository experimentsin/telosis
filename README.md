telosis
=======

An implementation of TELOS (EuLisp's reflective object system) in Scheme.

See the main ReadMe file for details of exactly what it is and what it
is not.

History
-------

I wrote this code while I was a postgraduate back in 1992. In
recognition of its coming of age some 21 years later, I commit it
to posterity by committing it to GitHub. ;)

This first submission is exactly as extracted from the tarball time
capsule I just found it in. Scheme implementations seem to be just as
fragmented and all-over-the-place today as they were all that time
ago, so I wish good luck to anyone interested enough to try to get it
up and running again!
