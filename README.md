TelosiS
=======

An implementation of TeloS (EuLisp's reflective object system) in Scheme.

See the main ReadMe file for details of what it is and what it
is not.

The fun part (if such there is) is in mop.scm where, after a little
bit of backstage bootstrap trickery, Telos itself is used to define
Telos. No, really, that kind of metacircular stuff was still
considered way-cool back in the early 90s...

History
-------

I wrote this code while I was a postgraduate back in 1992. In
recognition of its coming of age some 21 years later, I commit it
to posterity by committing it to GitHub. ;)

This first submission is exactly as extracted from the tarball time
capsule I just found it in. Scheme implementations seem to be just as
fragmented and all-over-the-place today as they were all that time
ago, so I wish good luck to anyone interested enough to try to get it
up and running again!
