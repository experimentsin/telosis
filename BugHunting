Common problems:

  o When using T, loading aborts with:

	** Error: wrong number of arguments to procedure -
	**        (DISPLAY "Loading TelosiS...")
	**        DISPLAY takes at least 0 arguments.

    or:

	** Error: variable FOR-EACH is unbound

    This happens if "telosis.t" or "telosis.t.c" are loaded before
    a (scheme-reset) call had been made to put T into Scheme mode.
    Call (scheme-reset) and reload the file.
