Sadly, I only know how to pull off file compilation in T.

With T: Load telosis interpreted by calling (load "telosis.t").
        Compile the files by calling (compile-telosis).
        Wait. (There'll be lots of "unreferenced variable" warnings flying
        past to keep you amused.)
        From now on the compiled telosis can be loaded by calling 
          (load "telosis.t.c").
